        <h4>"I'm locked up in my room 23 hours a day. That's been the case for 17 years. I have learned to entertain myself to keep myself motivated and I've done all kinds of things, I read a lot, and I do crochet and blankets and scarves and all kind of things. It feels great to create something".

        These are the words of Brandon Bernard. These are the words of yet another life brutally stolen by the US Justice System. Governmental executions are an intolerable denial of civil rights and are pure violations of the fundamental values of our justice system.  
        
        <br><br>To honor Brandon's passion for crocheting, I will be selling handmade crochet garments, of which 100% of profits will go to the Equal Justice Initiative (eji.org). The EJI provides legal assistance to inmates on death row, advocates for the abolishment of the death penalty, and is committed to ending mass incarceration and excessive punishments. 
        
        Each item will be entirely custom made to meet size and color needs. <br><br>There are three items available for purchase: tie-up bandanas, shoulder bags, and front-tie cardigans. See below for prices, pictures of the items, and other details, and thank you for your support! Please note that it may take some time to receive your items, as all items are completely handmade. 
        
        Please contact Gabi Cohen at 224-456-5731, gscohen6@gmail.com, or @gabicohenn on Instagram with any and all questions and comments!</h4>
